Theory Time : 

Time complexity of some commonly used Data Structures:
unordered_set => find,insert,delete => O(1)
unordered_map(implemented as Hash Table) => find,insert,delete => O(1) Avg,O(n) worst (when collisions are more)
map(implemented as Self balancing BST) => find,insert,delete => O(logn)
hash tables => O(1) Avg, O(n) worst (when collisions are more)
LinkedList,stack,queue => find => O(n), insert and delete(if element already found) => O(1)
Array => find,insert,delete => O(n)

Time complexity of some commonly of Sorting Techniques:
Bubble,insertion,selection => O(n^2) for both avg and worst
quickSort => O(nlogn)avg,O(n^2) in worst
mergeSort => O(nlogn) for both avg and worst
