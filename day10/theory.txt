what is Minheap? => 
1)It is a binary tree where parent is smaller than child
2)It is stored in an array

what is heap sort? =>
Heap sort is similar to selection sort
where we find maximum element and place maximum element at the end
arr[0] => root
so root will be minimum value
so like selection sort , we swap root with last element which
will put smallest element at the end and now remaining array(n-1 elements or n-2 index)
again has to be heapified in order to have minimum value again at the root
repeat the process for enitre array
